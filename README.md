# Aura Dataset - A BikePerception Dataset 

**A vision dataset for semantic segmentation and object detection recorded from a bike's perspective.**

This repository provides sample data and code for working with a custom dataset focused on urban mobility 
and perception tasks from the viewpoint of a bicycle. It includes data for **semantic segmentation** and 
**bounding box detection**, a TensorFlow-based training pipeline, and utilities for visualization.

> 📧 **Note**: Only sample data is included here. To request access to the full dataset for

## 📸 Sensor Setup

The dataset was recorded from a mobile sensor platform mounted on a cargo bike, 
capturing urban, park, and pedestrian areas.
It reflects the unique perspective and challenges of micromobility in diverse environments.

## 🧠 Tasks

### Semantic Segmentation

- Pixel-wise classification of urban scenes from the cyclist's point of view.

- Includes classes like pedestrians, cyclists, vehicles, infrastructure, etc.

- Ground truth provided as annotated label images.

### Bounding Box Detection

- Object detection in 2D using bounding boxes.

- Useful for detecting dynamic agents and static objects in shared mobility spaces.

## 🔬 Baseline Models

Baseline models are provided using TensorFlow. Each task comes with:

- Custom dataloaders

- Model architecture

- Training and testing scripts

- Pretrained models 

You can find them under:

- training/semantic/ for semantic segmentation

- training/bb/ for bounding box detection

### Bounding Boxes:

- YOLOv8 Models with backbones:
  - YOLOv8-XS
  - YOLOv8-L
